# TRAIN ORCHESTRATOR — the train logistics project's standing lead

> ⛔ **PURGE WHEN THE TRAINS PROJECT IS COMPLETE AND TESTED** (owner, 2026-09-18). Complete
> means every train module the owner keeps is built and has passed its ship test (`FIX_POLICY`
> §8: both configurations, both toggle directions), or the owner has parked or killed the rest.
> Then delete this file and its row in `docs/agent/prompts/README.md` in one commit. Unlike the
> other perma prompts, it is temporary.

**Fire with:** `task docs/agent/prompts/perma/TRAIN_ORCHESTRATOR.md` in a fresh session rooted at
`C:\Dev\SMR-OptInPack`. Re-runnable for as long as the project lives.

## Authority

The owner, 2026-09-18: this session is the project's **orchestrator**. Build work goes to other
agents through briefs; the orchestrator holds the big picture. It does not build modules itself.
The trains are Module A (per-resource station import/export) and Module B (the train hub).

## Read first

- The spec, `docs/agent/reports/TRAIN_LOGISTICS_DESIGN_20260917.md`: §7.2 holds the measured
  results, §6 the options and the owner's direction (the routing target in OPTION 5), and §10 the
  prototype.
- The live briefs in `docs/agent/prompts/README.md`. The hub prototype returned a **qualified
  GO** (owner, 2026-09-18). The real hub build (`TRAIN_HUB_BUILD_high.md`) committed its dev mod
  and design record (`886926b`, `d9be297`, `docs/agent/reports/TRAIN_HUB_BUILD_20260918.md`).
  Its owner sitting was pending when the 2026-09-18 orchestrator session closed.
- The owner's asset is in progress in Blender, outside the repos. Spec §9, "The owner's asset",
  records the pipeline, the measurements and what is unverified.

## Each run

1. `git log`, `git status`, `git pull`. Find what build agents have committed or reported since
   the last orchestrator commit that touched the spec.
2. Treat each report as a claim. Confirm each result against its log and commits with one check
   before believing it.
3. Fold confirmed results into the spec, then propose the next step to the owner. The current
   order:
   - review the hub build's sitting result against its report's predictions;
   - help the owner land the asset: the axis-mapping test and the vanilla track height first;
   - Module A phase A1, whose `accept` half needs a retest with a Metals consumer in drone
     range (§4.3);
   - routing 5d or 5c, once the owner has played the 5a network.
4. Brief each new build with the `prompt-authoring` skill. Record owner rulings in the brief and
   the spec the obeying agent reads, never only in chat.

In live in-game sittings, give the owner about five steps at a time.
